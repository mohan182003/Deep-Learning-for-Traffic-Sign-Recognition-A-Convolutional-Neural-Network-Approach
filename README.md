# Deep Learning for Traffic Sign Recognition: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach

Recognizing and classifying traffic signs is crucial for self-driving vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Traditional methods often fall short due to drivers missing signals, leading to potential accidents. However, with recent advancements in deep learning algorithms and high-performance hardware like GPUs, traffic sign recognition and classification has become faster and more efficient compared to traditional machine learning and computer vision approaches.

Building such systems is challenging due to various factors including lighting variations, vehicle speed, signal orientation, and image distortion. To capture high-quality traffic sign images and other visual features, wide-angle cameras are mounted on self-driving vehicles. However, these images can be distorted by external factors such as speed, sunlight, and rain.

To address this, I utilized the LeNet architecture and trained a convolutional neural network on the GTSRB dataset. The classifier extracts relevant features from training images and learns patterns to update weights and parameters. I employed TensorFlow, a powerful and user-friendly deep learning framework, for building the classifier. The accuracy of the trained classifier was then compared by classifying test images. Python was used as the programming language for this project
